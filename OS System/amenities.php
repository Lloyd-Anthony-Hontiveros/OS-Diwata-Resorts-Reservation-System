						<p>In publishing and graphic design, placeholder text is commonly used to demonstrate the
							elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout. Even
							though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity because of its resemblance to classical
							Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. Where text is visible in a document, people tend
							to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use
							lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design elements and page layout in order to direct
							the focus to the publication style and not the meaning of the text.</p>
